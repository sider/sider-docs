# News in 2019

This document describes notable changes on Sider in the year 2019.

## Update RuboCop and MeowCop for v0.78.0

<time class="news-date" datetime="2019-12-19">December 19, 2019</time>

[RuboCop 0.78.0](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v0.78.0) has been released but it includes a breaking change,
so we have released the quick update of our default RuboCop and MeowCop.
See below for details.

- [RuboCop](../tools/ruby/rubocop.md) - 0.77.0 to **0.78.0** ([changes](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v0.78.0))
- [MeowCop](../tools/ruby/rubocop.md#default-configuration) - 2.6.0 to **2.7.0** ([changes](https://github.com/sider/meowcop/releases/tag/v2.7.0))

## Update languages and tools on Dec 17, 2019

<time class="news-date" datetime="2019-12-17">December 17, 2019</time>

We have updated the following languages and tools, and made the following notable changes.

**Notable Changes**:

- The [PMD Java _Design_ rules](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_rules_java_design.html) have been added to the [Sider default rulesets](../tools/java/pmd.md#rulesets).
  The rules would help to detect potential problems in your Java code.
- When duplicate lock files `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` are found, Sider uses Yarn instead of raising an analysis error.
  This behavior change would help projects during migration from npm to Yarn.
  See also the [`npm_install`](../getting-started/custom-configuration.md#npm_install-option) option for details.
- **[Announcement]** We are planning to drop the support of **ESLint** and **RuboCop** older versions on **January 31, 2020**.
