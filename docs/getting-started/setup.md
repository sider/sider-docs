### Test Mode

Test Mode allows you to try Sider in your project, without getting in your teammates' way. In Test Mode, Sider will not block you from merging pull requests, regardless of the analysis result. However, if you have enabled Inline Commenting for your repository, Sider will still post comments to pull requests while in Test Mode.

Click "Analyze open pull requests" to start analysis. Sider will analyze your 3 latest pull requests.

You will be able to fine-tune your project's configuration at any time after the initial analysis.
