# Sider Enterprise Release Note in December 2020

## release-202012.0

**Notes**:

This release includes the new feature, [Analyzing branches](../../news/2020.md#analyzing-branches).
It might increase the number of analysis in your environment, so we updated [Storage](../system-overview.md#storage) size on System Overview.
However, the described size is not exactly calculated, so please monitor your resources carefully.

**Features**:

This release includes the following updates:

- **Runners version**: [0.38.1](https://github.com/sider/runners/releases/tag/0.38.1)
- [Analyzing branches](../../news/2020.md#analyzing-branches)

**Fixes**:

- Bug fixes & UI design improvements
- Fix a bug relevant to `DOCKER_RUNNERS_CONFIG.s3_endpoint`
  - Since `release-202008.0`, Sider Enterprise with AWS S3, instead of MinIO, had not worked.

**Images**:

See [Get Docker Image](../installation.md#get-docker-image). You can get the new image, specifying the tag: `release-202012.0`.

**Update Procedure**:

See [Update](../updating.md).
