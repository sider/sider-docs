# Transferring a repository

Currently, Sider cannot get notifications about the transfer of a repository on GitHub.
If you are a new owner of a transferred repository and
want Sider to analyze its source code, please take the following steps:

1. Migrate your organization to GitHub App if you haven't yet.
   - See [the announcement on our blog](https://blog.sideci.com/you-can-now-install-sider-as-a-github-app-f52a073b54b7) for more details.
2. Allow Sider to access the transferred repository.
   - Follow [this guide on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/reviewing-your-organizations-installed-integrations).
3. Let us know your organization and the previous owner of the repository.
   - Contact us via the chat button at the bottom right on [Sider](https://sider.review).
