# Sider Enterprise Release Note in February 2020

## release-202002.2

**Breaking Changes**:

If you are setting `ECS_RUNNERS_REGION`, you **MUST** rename the parameter name with `AWS_REGION_FOR_SIDER` and set the same value on it.

**Notes**:

From this release, Sider Enterprise does not require an OAuth App on your GitHub Enterprise,
and some users are redirected to the dialog page of your GitHub App.
Also, we improved the daily batch job and the total time of the batch will reduce from this release.

**Features**:

This release includes the following updates:

- [Update languages and tools on Feb 13, 2020](../../news/2020.md#update-languages-and-tools-on-feb-13-2020)

**Fixes**:

- Bug fixes & UI design improvements

**Images**:

Pulling the images with these commands:

```sh
# Log in
aws ecr get-login-password --profile sider-enterprise | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin docker.sider.review

# Pull image
docker pull docker.sider.review/sideci_onprem:release-202002.2
docker pull docker.sider.review/catpost_onprem:release-202002.2

# Log out
docker logout docker.sider.review
```

If you didn't configure the credential yet, run the following command to configure it.

```sh

aws configure --profile sider-enterprise set region us-east-1
aws configure --profile sider-enterprise
```
