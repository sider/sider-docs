## PLEASE CHECK GitHub Enterprise Server Version

Sider requires GitHub Enterprise Server `2.22` or later from these releases. Please ask the administrator of your GitHub Enterprise Server if you don't know its version.

## release-202101.1

**Notes**:

We had changed the handling of access tokens for public repositories in [release-202101.0](#release-2021010), but we found out this does not work with GitHub Entgerprise Server with [private mode](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/configuration/enabling-private-mode) enabled. If you activate this feature on your GitHub Enterprise Server, skip [release-202101.0](#release-2021010) and update to [release-202101.1](#release-2021011).
