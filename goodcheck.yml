      Prefer `sider.yml` over `sideci.yml`

      `sideci.yml` is supported for the backward compatibility, but Sider recognizes `sider.yml` more preferentially.
      Please use `sider.yml` in the documentation.

    message: |
      Be careful when using the word `master` as a branch name.

      GitHub and some projects renamed their default branch from `master` to `main`.
      If `master` is included in a URL, the URL may return 404 in the future.

    justification:
      - When the word `master` is not used as a branch name.
      - When there is no other suitable word.
