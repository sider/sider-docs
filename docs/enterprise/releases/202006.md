```sh
# Configure your AWS credentials and region
aws configure --profile sider-enterprise set region us-east-1
aws configure --profile sider-enterprise
```

**Update Procedure**:

Follow the update procedures below:

1. Stop all Sider Enterprise services.
2. Run the database migration.

   ```sh
   docker run docker.sider.review/sideci_onprem:release-202006.0 \
     bundle exec rails db:migrate
   ```

3. Run the data migration scripts (It takes long time.)

   ```sh
   docker run docker.sider.review/sideci_onprem:release-202006.0 \
     bundle exec rails r script/migrate/20200520_migrate_deprecated_go_tools.rb
   docker run docker.sider.review/sideci_onprem:release-202006.0 \
     bundle exec rails r script/migrate/20200515_migrate_abyssinian_to_laperm.rb
   ```

4. Remove the catpost services.
5. Start the services.

> If you are using Dockre Compose, prefix `docker-compose run SERVICE_NAME` before the COMMAND, such as `bundle exec rails db:migrate`. Of course, don't forget to update your docker-compose.yml with the new release tag.
