# Billing and Plans

## Sider Plans

Sider's plan depends on the number of users who are assigned seats. The seat-assigned users can check analysis results, close/reopen issues, post comments to the pull requests.

| Price | Public Repositories | Private Repositories |
|:---|:--:|:--:|
| $12 USD/month(or ¥1,500 JPY/month) per seat | Unlimited | Unlimited |

You can upgrade the plan and increase/decrease seats in the organization settings page.

You must have the owner role for your organization if you would like to change organization settings or repository settings.

Additionally, we have prepared the 14-day trial plan. This trial plan will start when you add the first private repository and will allow you to try Sider without any limitations. And, private repositories will be no longer analyzed when the trial has been expired.

At this time, Sider will change your plan to the Free plan unless you update Sider's plan. The Free plan analyzes your public repositories, however, one doesn't analyze your private repositories.
