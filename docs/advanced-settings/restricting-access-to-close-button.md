# Restricting access to Close button

Users with admin permissions for a repository can restrict closing issues only to users with admin permissions. By default, all users with write permissions can close issues. See also [Permissions](../getting-started/permissions.md).

After enabling this for all users who have write permissions, the Close button will be disabled like the following:
