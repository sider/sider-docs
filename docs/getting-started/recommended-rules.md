# Recommended Ruleset

Static code analysis tool can improve the quality of your source-code because it ensures coding-style across a project and also detects possible coding errors without any test executions. However, static analysis with its default configuration typically reports a lot of issues. Some of them aren't applicable to your projects and are called "false positive". Most analysis tool has a capability to let users to enable/disable analysis rules to be actively used. You may try to determine if the rule is really a good match for your projects. But a huge amount of issues makes it difficult to manually verify all of them.

For certain analysis tools listed in [Analysis tools including recommended ruleset generated by this algorithm](#analysis-tools-including-recommended-ruleset-generated-by-this-algorithm), Sider provides our recommended ruleset which can reduce false positives. We introduce our own automated classifier based on K-means machine learning algorithm. We train the classifier to classify which rules to address or not to fix by counting the number of commits where the issue is reported and it is fixed, using a total of about 3.6 million commits over 1,000 popular OSS repositories. This study is conducted in collaboration with Prof. Shingo TAKADA¹ of Keio University in Kanagawa, Japan and Prof. Masataka NAGURA² of Nanzan University in Aichi, Japan.

Sider automatically applies the recommended ruleset for analysis tools listed [below](#analysis-tools-including-recommended-ruleset-generated-by-this-algorithm) when a configuration file doesn't exist in your repository. Since the recommended rulesets are available on our website, you can modify and place it in your repository as required for correct analysis of your projects.
