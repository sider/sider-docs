# 201911.0

From this release, you don't have to set up **setaria** component, which was used for performing analyses. Instead, Sider runs **runners** with Docker directly. **Runners** are just containers that perform analyses and they were executed by **setaria** component before. You should still take care of the Docker host performance issues, but direct usage by Sider reduces the maintenance of another component.

## How to upgrade

If you set up Sider with docker-compose, removes `setaria_web` and `setaria_worker` services from the `docker-compose.yml`. Also, you must allow `sideci_worker` to call Docker API. If you want to `sideci_worker` to access Docker via Unix socket, don't forget to attach Docker socket (e.g. `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`).

To upgrade to this release, the following environment variables are newly needed.

- [RUNNERS_TRACES_S3_BUCKET_NAME](../config.md#runners_traces_s3_bucket_name)
- [DOCKER_RUNNERS_CONFIG](../config.md#docker_runners_config)

See each link for more details.
